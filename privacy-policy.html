    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how we collect, protect, and use personally identifiable information ("Personal Information") you ("User", "you" or "your") may provide in All AC Remote Control (collectively "Mobile Application"). It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your Personal Information and how you may access and update this information. This Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that we do not own or control, or to individuals that we do not employ or manage. This Policy covers our collection, use, and disclosure of your information through the App. It does not include any third-party collection, use, or disclosure through any application, website, or product that we do not control or own, such as Facebook or any other third-party features provided through the Application.</p>

    <h2>Permissions we use</h2>
    <p>We only use 1 Permission:</p>
    <p><strong>android.permission.INTERNET</strong> for internet access to improve user experience and to access the main functionality of the application.</p>
    <p>We undertake that this authorization is not for personal use and is provided to third parties. However, this data is not collected on our servers or shared with third parties; the data is only stored on your device.</p>

    <h2>Collecting personal information</h2>
    <p>We receive and store any information you knowingly provide us with in the Mobile App. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of some Mobile App features. Users who are unsure of the required information can contact us.</p>

    <h2>Use and process collected information</h2>
    <p>Any information we collect from you may be used for the following purposes:</p>
    <p>Collected Non-Personal Information is used only to identify potential abuse cases and to establish traffic statistics and use of the Mobile App. This statistical information is not aggregated in any other way to identify any specific user of the system.</p>
    <p>We may process Personal Information regarding you if any of the following applies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>(i) You have agreed with them for one or more specific purposes. Note that under certain laws, we may be allowed to process information until you object to such processing (by opting out) without needing to rely on consent or any other legal basis.</li>
        <li>(ii) The provision of information is necessary to perform an agreement with you and/or for any of its pre-contractual obligations therein.</li>
        <li>(iii) Processing is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which you are subject.</li>
        <li>(iv) The processing is in connection with a task performed for the public good or in the exercise of official authority assigned to us.</li>
        <li>(v) Processing is necessary for legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In all cases, we will be happy to clarify the specific legal basis applicable to processing and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual requirement or a requirement necessary to sign a contract.</p>

    <h2>Transfer and store information</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location, data transmission may involve transferring and storing your information in a country other than your own. You have the right to inquire about the legal basis for the transfer of information to a country outside the European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or established by two or more countries, such as the United Nations, and on the security measures taken by us to protect your information. If any such transfer takes place, you can learn more by checking the relevant sections of this document or by contacting us using the information provided in the contact section.</p>

    <h2>User rights</h2>
    <p>You can exercise certain rights regarding your information handled by us. Specifically, you have the right to do the following:</p>

        <li>(vii) You have the right to receive your information in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format and, if technically feasible, to have it transmitted to another controller without any hindrance. This provision is applicable provided that your information is processed by automated means and that the processing is based on your consent, on a contract which you are part of, or on pre-contractual obligations thereof.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Right to object to processing</h2>
    <p>Where Personal Information is processed for the public interest, in the exercise of an official authority vested in us, or for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us, you may object to such processing by providing a ground related to your particular situation to justify the objection. However, you must know that, should your Personal Information be processed for direct marketing purposes, you can object to that processing at any time without providing any justification. To learn whether we are processing Personal Information for direct marketing purposes, you may refer to the relevant sections of this document.</p>

    <h2>How to exercise these rights</h2>
